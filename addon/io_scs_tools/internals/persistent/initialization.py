    Things which this function does:
    1. copies all the settings to current world
    2. checks object identities
    3. updates shaders presets path and reloads them

    Cases when it should be run:
    1. Blender startup -> SCS tools needs to configured
    2. Opening .blend file -> because all the configs needs to be moved to current world
    3. addon reloading and enable/disable -> for SCS tools this is the same as opening Blender
